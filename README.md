# HackGPT

Welcome to HackGPT — a brand-new event where you’ll build your own intelligent chatbot that’s as helpful 🤗 as WALL-E and as curious 🤔 as EVE!

We’ll guide 🤝 you through building a retrieval augmented generation (RAG)-powered multi-agentic full stack application in Python 🐍 that will replace your dependency on ChatGPT with your own personalized version for whatever data you may want to index ☝️. Whether you’re a beginner or intermediate developer 🧑‍💻, by the end of this 4-hour workshop you’ll have the skills necessary to create your own Langchain pipelines from scratch! ⚒️

Follow along with our [Workshop Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1khUfbhE8ZyN5XE8w-zFW5AnMIov4grH43iF2zcBU43c/edit) and with the code for the demos located inside of this repository!
